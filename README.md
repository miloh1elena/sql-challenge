# Pewlett Hackard Employee Database - Data Analysis - SqlChallenge - Module 9: ReadMe

## Introduction

This ReadMe covers the essentials of the Pewlett Hackard employee database. Several data analysis tasks have been performed in this database, including designing tables, importing data from CSV files, and modifying the database. The purpose of this manual is to explain the structure of the database, how to import data, and how to conduct specific analyses using SQL queries.

## Database Structure

The following tables were created: 

1. departments

2. employees

3. dept_emp

4. dept_managers

5. salaries

6. titles

## Data Import

To populate these tables with data, the `copy` command was used to import CSV files. Each table corresponds to a CSV file, and thus it was critical to ensure that the data types, primary keys, and foreign keys matched the provided schema.

## Data Analysis

We performed various data analysis tasks using SQL queries. Here are some examples:

- Listing Employee Details

- Hiring Year Analysis

- Department Management Analysis

- Employee Department Analysis

- Employee Filtering

- Sales Department Analysis
